	<p class="blog-content text-red">A 300 word essay double-spaced will take up 1 page—just enough to cover the basic parts of an essay—the introduction, body, and conclusion.
	Yes, this is very little space to write your opinion on a complex topic, but it is doable with careful planning. The secret to being able to efficiently
	planning a short essay is knowing how many paragraphs is a 300-word essay. You can divide your short essay into 3 paragraphs, each one corresponding
	to the introduction, body, and conclusion. However, you can still opt to divide the main body into 2 or 3 paragraphs if topic is a bit complex.
	For example, a 300-word essay on respect for other cultures, you may need to divide the body into 3 paragraphs; while if you’re writing
	a 300-word scholarship essay you may opt for just 1 paragraph in the body.</p>

	<p class="blog-content text-purple">First off, let us look at ‘the essence’ method used by very many professional writers around the world.
	This tip involves writing down everything that comes to mind with regards to your topic. Do not worry about grammar or spelling; just type everything
	out in one go. Then you will have a general overview of what you need to include in your essay. If it helps, number each point so that it is easier
	for you to refer back to the individual points you have made.</p>

	<p class="text-maroon page">Writing a 300 word essay can be challenging.A paragraph is the best way to organize your thoughts for writing an essay, so here are some tips
	on how to write paragraphs in a 300-word essay.First, you should lay out three points that will make up your argument and set up the discussion
	you will have about them in subsequent paragraphs. You should also indicate what each point means and why it matters for the discussion.
	This may seem obvious, but many people forget these steps when they’re writing an introduction paragraph or when they try to introduce one of their 
	points later on in the paper. You must always remember that this is not just a list of facts; rather, you are trying to argue something through your
	evidence.To finish off your introduction, you should summarize what will be discussed in the paper and how your evidence will support these points.
	Your conclusion paragraph is an important part of the essay as well, so make sure to not just restate your points or put forth a weak argument. 
	You want to remind readers of why they should care about 3(a), then connect that thought back to the original point (2) and link to it with a statement
	like “we see this idea exemplified in x” or something like that. Finally, you want to conclude by outlining what you hope people take away from reading
	this essay.</p>
