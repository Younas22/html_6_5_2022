	<p class='pergrph-font'>A 300 word essay double-spaced will take up 1 page—just enough to cover the basic parts of an essay—the introduction, body, and conclusion.
	Yes, this is very little space to write your opinion on a complex topic, but it is doable with careful planning. The secret to being able to efficiently
	planning a short essay is knowing how many paragraphs is a 300-word essay. You can divide your short essay into 3 paragraphs, each one corresponding
	to the introduction, body, and conclusion. However, you can still opt to divide the main body into 2 or 3 paragraphs if topic is a bit complex.
	For example, a 300-word essay on respect for other cultures, you may need to divide the body into 3 paragraphs; while if you’re writing
	a 300-word scholarship essay you may opt for just 1 paragraph in the body.
